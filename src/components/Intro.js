                On Tuesday, April 17, Ariad Communications declared bankruptcy,
                suddenly shutting its doors after nearly 30 years of service.
                Over 70 passionate, award-winning marketing professionals were
                kicked to the curb, robbed of outstanding wages, packages and,
                even worse, a direct explanation from their CEO.
            </p>

                overwhelming.
